QD Channel integration for ns-3
================================

## QD Channel code
This repository contains in the code for the ns-3 integration of the [QD channel model implementation from NIST and University of Padova](https://github.com/signetlabdei/qd-realization). Please refer to the repository of the QD implementation for a complete documentation on how to generate new scenarios. In this repository, we provide a first example based on a simple indoor scenario.

The implementation leverages the spectrum implementation of the matrix-based channel model introduced in ns-3.31, described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.09341).

The example `qd-channel-model-example.cc` can be used as a starting point to understand how to use the ray tracer in wireless simulations with ns-3.

## Install

### Prerequisites ###

To run simulations using this module, you will need to install ns-3, and clone
this repository inside the `contrib` directory. 
Required dependencies include git and a build environment.

#### Installing dependencies ####

Please refer to [the ns-3 wiki](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/Installation) for instructions on how to set up your system to install ns-3.

#### Downloading #####

First, clone the main ns-3 repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev ns-3-dev
```

Then, clone the qd-channel module:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/signetlabdei/qd-channel ns-3-dev/contrib/qd-channel
```

### Compilation ###

Configure and build ns-3 from the `ns-3-dev` folder:

```bash
./waf configure --enable-tests --enable-examples
./waf build
```

This module does not provide Python bindings at the moment, they will be added in the near future.

### Documentation ###

To compile the documentation, please follow the instructions from the [ns-3 manual](https://www.nsnam.org/docs/manual/html/documentation.html).

1. Istall the dcumentation-specific depdendencies as described in the [ns-3 installation guide](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/Installation)
1. You might need to fix the ImageMagick permissions for ghostscript files
1. In `doc/models/source/index.rst`, add `qd-channel` in the TOC tree
1. In `doc/models/Makefile`, add `../../contrib/qd-channel/doc/qd-channel.rst` as one of the `SOURCES`
1. Run in your terminal, in the ns-3 root folder, `make -C doc/models html`
1. Open with your browser the file `doc/models/build/html/qd-channel.html`. You should locate the `qd-channel` in the TOC, as added before
